      Star Wars is an American epic space-opera multimedia franchise created by
      George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became
      a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into
      various films and other media, including television series, video games,
      novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising
      an all-encompassing fictional universe. In 2020, its total value was
      estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing
      media franchise of all time. The original film (Star Wars), retroactively
      subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels

      series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom
      Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III:
      Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to
      Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel
      trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode
      VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker
      (2019).All nine films of the "Skywalker Saga" were nominated for Academy
      Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the
      theatrical live action "anthology" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018),
      the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10
      billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all
      time. Additional upcoming films are in the works, including an untitled
      movie from Taika Waititi planned for 2023 and Rogue Squadron directed by
      Patty Jenkins, which currently does not have a release date.

    <h2><span id="Story"> Story</span></h2>
    <p id="story_text">
      The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time
      ago in a galaxy far, far away", in which humans and many species of aliens
      (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films
      as 'droids'), who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel
      between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.
      <br />The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts
      scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along
      with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which,
      in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.<br />
      The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as
      asteroid fields and nebulae. Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to
      huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations such as
      the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and
      audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and HoloNet (internet
      counterpart). <br />The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to ours
      but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative
      stories. One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which
      is described in the original film as "an energy field created by all
      living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together". The field is depicted
      as a kind of pantheistic god. Through training and meditation, those whom
      "the Force is strong with" are able to perform various superpowers (such
      as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical
      energy). It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force. The mentioned
      powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each
      other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the
      light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the
      Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.
      <br />While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or
      'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their
      apprentice. Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to
      the population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a
      lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface
      and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades
      and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms. As a result of
      galaxy-scaled politics, all this weaponry is made use of in various
      military conflicts during which most Star Wars material takes place.<br />
      In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt
      cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters
      and governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery. Planets
      allowing for countless settings and incredible life variety, technology on
      various advancement levels, and fantasy elements make Star Wars a very
      universal franchise. Virtually every genre and type of story can be
      adapted to fit into the franchise.
